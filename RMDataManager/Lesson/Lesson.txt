out the box Vaildation with Caliburn and micro
if you have a text box field in a from and you make the prop on the code side = int then caliburn we only let you enter a number in that field and will pop us with error
to the user saying only enter num outlining the box in red this is how they handel different types even if a textbox return string if the wired up prop is a diff data type
it will only let u enter what can be converted to that type I believe caliburn does the converions under the hood
