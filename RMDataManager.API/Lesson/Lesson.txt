out the box Vaildation with Caliburn and micro
if you have a text box field in a from and you make the prop on the code side = int then caliburn we only let you enter a number in that field and will pop us with error
to the user saying only enter num outlining the box in red this is how they handel different types even if a textbox return string if the wired up prop is a diff data type
it will only let u enter what can be converted to that type I believe caliburn does the converions under the hood


problem we run into With Caliburn and Micro

had a prop that use to be called AvailableRoles in veiwModel and on the view but coz caliburn and micro have a special naming convention so the view couldnt fire of 
the event so we had to change it to SelectedAvailableRole one of the rules it has to be singular coz the view is giving plural its expect a singular prop to come 
to it so it looks for a singular naming convention so we change the name of the prop
i.e in ViewModel UserDisplayViewModel prop SelectedAvailableRole

Dapper methods and what they do 



//assigning roles
[Authorize(Roles = "Cashier")]//this is assigning one role 

[Authorize(Roles = "Cashier, Admin")]// the , separte means or so Cashier || Admin

[Authorize(Roles = "Cashier")]
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]//stack on top this means && you have to have both roles to access this 

[AllowAnonymous]//means u dont have to be auth for this action even if the whole controller is auth 

RequestContext.Principal.IsInRole("Admin")//returns a bool check to see if the user has this role u can use this with an if() so if admin and manager both how permissions
for a method but we want to give admin more info then we just wrapp this in an if and rite the code inside it i.e print every detail elseif manager print only clients
and staff details i.e (Tim corey vid 27 adding roles to api 32:00)
